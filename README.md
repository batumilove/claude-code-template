# Claude Code Template

A GitHub template repository with CLAUDE.md best practices for projects using Claude Code AI assistant.

## What is this?

This template provides a starting point for projects that will use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) as an AI coding assistant. It includes a well-structured `CLAUDE.md` file that helps Claude understand your project's architecture, conventions, and common workflows.

## Why use CLAUDE.md?

When Claude Code works on your project, it automatically reads the `CLAUDE.md` file to understand:
- Your project's structure and architecture
- Common commands and workflows
- Coding conventions and standards
- Known issues and their solutions
- Project-specific patterns and requirements

This leads to more accurate and helpful assistance from Claude.

## Getting Started

1. **Use this template**: Click the "Use this template" button on GitHub to create a new repository based on this template.

2. **Clone your new repository**:

3. **Customize CLAUDE.md**: Edit the `CLAUDE.md` file to match your project:
   - Update the project name and description
